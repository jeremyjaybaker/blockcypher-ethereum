# Blockcypher::Ethereum
A wrapper for Blockcypher's Ethereum API (https://www.blockcypher.com/dev/ethereum/). I made this since Blockcypher is still working on their official Ethereum API wrapper. I also wanted to experiment with an API wrapper who's essential functionality could be defined exclusively with json.

## Usage
